This folder contains FunC sources of some real-used smart contracts:
- [wallet-v4](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract)
- [modern-jetton](https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK/modern_jetton)
- [bridge-func](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bridge-func)
- [single-nominator-pool](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator)

and tests for these smart contracts generated by TON the synbolic analyzer.

Each project is based on Blueprint template, so `contracts` folders contain FunC sources, `wrappers` contan corresponding Typescript wrappers, and `tests` contain generated tests. To execute generated tests, run the command `yarn jest` in the root of a project.

Each generated test can be reproduced by running the analysis tool with the `test-gen option` 
(for more details see embedded help).
